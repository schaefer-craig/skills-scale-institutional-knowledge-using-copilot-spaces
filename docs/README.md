# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

## Overview

OctoAcme employs a structured and transparent project management approach that emphasizes customer value, iterative delivery, and clear ownership throughout the project lifecycle. Projects begin with a clearly defined initiation phase, followed by focused planning, rigorous execution anchored by quality assurance practices, and a disciplined release process. Personas such as Project Managers, Product Managers, Developers, QA/Testing, and Stakeholders each have clearly defined responsibilities. Communication is maintained with regular cadences (standups, syncs, updates), and risks are proactively managed and escalated. Continuous improvement is encouraged through retrospectives and tracked action items, ensuring learning and quality drive organizational success.

## Project Management Principles

OctoAcme's approach is guided by core principles that drive every project:

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in all decisions
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments to reduce risk
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has named Project Manager and Product Lead
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback and learning across all teams

## Key Personas & Roles

Projects at OctoAcme involve clearly defined roles with specific responsibilities:

- **Project Managers**: Coordinate delivery activities, manage schedules, risks, and communications
- **Product Managers**: Define outcomes, prioritize backlog, and measure success
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design and testability
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs, approvals, and feedback

## Project Lifecycle

OctoAcme projects follow a structured lifecycle:

1. **Initiation**: Define problem statement, identify stakeholders, establish high-level timeline
2. **Planning**: Break work into shippable increments, identify dependencies and risks
3. **Execution**: Build, test, review, and iterate with daily team coordination
4. **Release**: Deploy, verify, and announce with proper rollback plans
5. **Close & Retrospective**: Capture learnings and convert them into action items

## Communication & Collaboration

Regular communication cadences ensure alignment and transparency:

- **Daily standups** (15 min): Focus on progress, blockers, and dependencies
- **Weekly PM + PdM sync**: Alignment on priorities and risks
- **Twice-weekly delivery team standups**: Team coordination (or as agreed)
- **Weekly delivery syncs**: Show progress, updates, and flagged risks
- **Monthly stakeholder updates**: Keep leadership informed
- **Sprint/milestone demos**: Showcase completed work
- **Ad-hoc escalations**: Address urgent issues as they arise

## Quality Assurance Practices

OctoAcme maintains high quality through rigorous practices:

- **Automated testing**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end smoke tests
- **Code review process**: PRs require approval before merging
- **CI/CD integration**: Automated tests and security scans in pipeline
- **Definition of Done**: Clear acceptance criteria for all work items
- **Manual QA**: Feature acceptance validation when needed
- **Security scanning**: Continuous security checks in CI
- **Small PRs**: Keep changes focused (≤ 400 lines when possible)

## Risk Management

Risks are proactively identified, assessed, and mitigated:

- **Risk Register**: Track risks with impact, likelihood, owner, and mitigation plans
- **Regular review**: Update risk status at weekly syncs
- **Clear escalation paths**: Team → PM → Product Lead → Sponsor
- **Incident response**: Follow runbooks with blameless post-mortems
